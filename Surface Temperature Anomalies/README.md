# Surface Tempearture 
The MOD11A1 V6 product provides daily land surface temperature (LST) and emissivity values in a 1200 x 1200 kilometer grid. The temperature value is derived from the MOD11_L2 swath product. Above 30 degrees latitude, some pixels may have multiple observations where the criteria for clear-sky are met. When this occurs, the pixel value is the average of all qualifying observations. Provided along with both the day-time and night-time surface temperature bands and their quality indicator layers are MODIS bands 31 and 32 and six observation layers.

# Surface Tempearture Anomalies

Anomalies calculated comparing average values for July and August 2020 (reference perieod July-August 2003 to 2016)

## Use

Average daytime surface temperatures anomalies for July and August 2020 compared with the average between 2000 and 2016 Analysis performed by L. Battistella in November 2020. Use the raw csv to retrieve all data or single country or PA data given the parameter: iso3 or wdpaid
