# Global Human Modification
The global Human Modification dataset (gHM) provides a cumulative measure of human modification of terrestrial lands globally at 1 square-kilometer resolution. The gHM values range from 0.0-1.0 and are calculated by estimating the proportion of a given location (pixel) that is modified, the estimated intensity of modification associated with a given type of human modification or "stressor". 5 major anthropogenic stressors circa 2016 were mapped using 13 individual datasets:

human settlement (population density, built-up areas)
agriculture (cropland, livestock)
transportation (major, minor, and two-track roads; railroads)
mining and energy production
electrical infrastructure (power lines, nighttime lights)
Please see the paper for additional methodological details. This asset was re-projected to WGS84 for use in Earth Engine.
